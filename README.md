# Zacks-Programming-Projects
This is a repository of some code I have completed in my free time as well as assignments through school. :)

I have listed 4 C programs Random story generator, smoothie ingredients, blob finder, and war simulator.
the Last file is a a JAVA program labeld Scraggle.

****Important! to open the java program labeled scraggle you will have to open the whole scraggle file with a java IDE such as netBeans to play the game.

Scraggle: A fun interactive game deomonstrating a good understanding of OOP as well as some front end java programming.

C Programs: The other four C programs are just in here to show my knowledge on key computer science concepts such as, Run Time(Big O), various sorting algorithims(bubble sort, merge sort etc..) , hash tables, recursion, and linked list. 


Currently working on a python code to add to this repository and an apple app programmed in swift, so stay tuned!! :)
