# Zacks-Programming-Projects
This is a repository of some code I have completed in my free time as well as assignments through school.

I have listed 3 C programs Random story generator, smoothie ingredients, and blob finder.
the Last file is a a JAVA program.

****Important! to open the java program labeled scraggle you will have to open the whole scraggle file into a java IDE such as netBeans.
